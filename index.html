            <h1>About Me</h1>
              <p>
              <br>I am a highly passionate and dedicated software developer with extensive experience in creating scalable, efficient, and high-performance applications. My expertise spans a wide array of technologies,
              <br>but I am particularly specialized in designing advanced graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and developing reliable embedded systems.
              <br>With a solid educational background in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from IIS Ettore Majorana,
              <br>I have developed a deep understanding of both hardware and software integration. This unique combination of theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience allows me to design intuitive and responsive interfaces while solving complex technical challenges in embedded systems development.
              <br>Over the course of my career, I have honed my skills in several key areas, including user interface design, algorithm development, and communication protocol implementation. My programming proficiency spans a variety of languages, such as C, Python, and C#, which I leverage to deliver robust, efficient, and maintainable code.
              <br>In addition to my technical expertise in software development, I have significant experience in firmware development. This includes writing low-level code to interact directly with hardware components, as well as optimizing firmware for resource-constrained embedded systems. I am proficient in designing firmware for a variety of embedded platforms, from microcontrollers to complex real-time systems. My work in firmware development involves not only ensuring the functionality <br>of embedded devices but also enhancing their performance, stability, and energy efficiency, all while maintaining stringent system requirements.
              <br>I have a proven track record in implementing and optimizing communication protocols, such as Serial, TCP/IP, ModBus, and CANbus. These protocols are critical to ensuring the functionality and reliability of embedded solutions across multiple industries, including automotive, energy, and structural monitoring. By combining my technical abilities with a keen eye for detail and a problem-solving mindset, I have contributed to numerous successful projects that enhance system <br>performance, optimize resource usage, and increase overall reliability.
              <br>As a self-taught web developer, I have also gained extensive experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I dedicated considerable time to learning front-end web technologies and now feel comfortable building modern, responsive websites from scratch. I have mastered HTML for creating structured and semantic web pages, CSS for styling and laying out attractive, user-friendly interfaces, and JavaScript for adding interactivity and dynamic functionality. My ability to learn and apply <br>these skills independently has allowed me to create websites that are not only visually appealing but also performant and accessible across devices and screen sizes.
              <br>As I continue to grow in my career, I am excited to take on new challenges that allow me to apply my skills to innovative projects and contribute to the development of cutting-edge technology solutions, both in software, firmware, and web development.
